# Shzam CLI

This is an open-source Project that provides a starter template for building Node.js with TypeScript. The project comes with a clean folder structure, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest, making it easy for developers to write clean and maintainable code while promoting best practices for new projects.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. install the package ```npm i -g shzam```
2. To create project run ``` shzam init```

## Currently supported

currently it only have 2 templates.

1. Empty Template :- This template does not include any framework; it only has basic Node.js and TypeScript configurations.

2. Nodejs/Expressjs :- This template comes with the basic configuration of Express.js and Node.js with TypeScript, along with some boilerplate code that can speed up the development process. Additionally, it also contains a test example.

## Planned For the Future

1. Graphql Support

2. prisma Support

4. module code genarotr with CRUD and test boilerplate


## Design Pattern

we are promting using the ```Repository pattern```. the Nodejs/Expressjs comes with example project you can look how to use the boilerplate, we aim to mimize the code need to be writen by the programers. i have come up with this folder structure based on my experince in diffrent framework i worked used.
